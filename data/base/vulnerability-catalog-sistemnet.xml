     Vulnerabilities catalog

     Introduce resource types that might contain certain vulnerability. In that way it wouldn't
     be necessary to check all the vulnerabilities when searching for a vulnerability of a
     certain resource. Currently, tags are planned for this purpose, but it isn't fully supported
     yet.

     For vulnerabilities obtained from OWASP, there is an attribute resource_type set to
     webapp. But, this should be also converted to tags.
