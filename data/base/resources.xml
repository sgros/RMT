	Resources database.

	The application supports resource specializtion. It is used to specialize
	specific resource to suit better to a particular organization's needs.
	All the risks and vulnerabilities identified for the general resource
	are automatically valid for the specialized one, too.

	To identify specialization, instead of attribute "id" use attribute
	"baseid", and don't use "id". That attribute should point to base class.


    Resources have some attributes that are inherent to it. Those attributes
    are:

	value	Attribute of both, denoting the value of the resource

    Resources can be in different relationship to each other. Currently
    defined relationships are the following ones:

    1. A ispartof B (B iscomposedof A)

        This is a physical relationship which describes that one resource (A)
        is a part of some other resource (B). In other words, if we remove
        resource A from B, then B isn't complete any more, or even doesn't
        exist any more. Some examples:

            (hard disk) ispartof (desktop computer)

        Vulnerabilities:
		Vulnerability of resource A is vulnerability of resource B also.

        Threats:
		Threat to resource A is threat to resource B also.

		If threat is successful on A it is also successful on B.

	Based on this relationship material value of resources is computed.
	If the value of B is known, then A's value is computed by dividing
	B's value with number of subparts, taking into account eventual ponder.

	Additional information related to this form of relationship:

		share	Attribute of A. Percentage A makes of B.

	This is designated by having the following element within A's
	description:

		<ispartof "id_of_B" />

    2. A isin B (B has A)

       This is a physical relationship in which one resource (B) embodies
       some other (A). But this other resource (A) isn't a part of the
       resource that embodies it (B). Some examples:

            (server computer) isin (data center)

       Note that we can not say that:

            (hard disk) isin (desktop computer)

       because hard disk is an essentail part of a desktop computer and as
       such, their relationship is more complex.

        Vulnerabilities:
		Vulnerability of A isn't vulnerability of B.

        Threats:
		Threat to A is threat to B only if it is of physical nature,
		in that case, threat to reach A has first to pass B.

		It might be said that B is control measure to protect A.

    3. A communicateswith B

       This signals exchange of information from resource A to resource
       B. This is a unidirectional flow and it can be achieved using
       different means, most likely using some form of the network, but
       there are other possibilities like letters, USB sticks, shared
       disk.

        Vulnerabilities:
		Vulnerability of A isn't vulnerability of B nor
		vulnerability of B is a vulnerability of A.

        Threats:
		Threat that acts on A doesn't influence B. The same is
		the other way around, threat on B doesn't affect A.

		When threat is successful on either A or B, it now becomes
		threat to other resource.

	This is designated by having the following element within A's
	description:

		<communicateswith "id_of_B" />

    4. A uses B

       This means that resource A uses computing resource B. Resource A
       is some human, while resource B is some kind of computing device.

       This is designated by having the following element within A's
       description:

		<uses "id_of_B" />

    4. A suppliesenergyto B (unidirectional)

	Vulnerabilities:

	Threats:

    5. A attachedto B (bidirectional)

       A is attached to B, e.g. computer is attached to a switch, or
       switch is attached to router. This is a physical level
       attachment that might, or might not, allow communication of
       the two devices in normal situation, but nevertheless it 
       doesn't mean that the attacker can not establish some kind of
       a communication between the two. Again, as an example, computer
       is connected to a switch and normaly switch only relays information
       between different devices. But, it is possible for a attacker to
       try to attack switch itself if it managed to get to a computer.

        Vulnerabilities:

        Threats:

    6. A isinstanceof B (B istypeof A)

       This represents typeing/subtyping of different resources. For
       example, Windows 7 is instance of Windows OS, which in turn is
       instance of OS. The opposite direction is, Windows is type of
       operating system, while Windows 7 is type of Windows OS. Also,
       some specific desktop computer is an instance of class of
       desktop computers.

        Vulnerabilities:

        Threats:

    7. A executeson B (B executes A)

       This relationship is used to denote that resource A is executing
       within or on resource B. In this case A is a software, and B is
       some computing device. Note that computing device might be a
       hardware, but also some virtual machine, or interpreter.

       As an example, we can take operating system executing on a
       computer, or browser executing on a computer.

       To denote that A has certain capabilities/privileges on B that
       can endager it in certain scale (privileged vs. unprivileged
       execution) additional data should be added in form of impact
       measure.

        Vulnerabilities:

        Threats:

       This is designated by having the following element within A's
       description:

		<executeson "id_of_B" />

       Alternatively, it is possible to define on B that A is executed
       on it using the following element:

		<executes "id_of_A" />

    8. A stores B (B storedon A)

	This relationship denotes that A stores/hosts B. Most likely,
	B will be some kind of data, or applications, that is stored
	A which can be server, workstation, CD, USB and a like.

	This is designated by having the following element within A's
	description:

		<stores id="id_of_B" />

	Alternatively, to designate that B is storead on A, the following
	tag is used:

		<storedon id="id_of_A" />

        Vulnerabilities:

        Threats:


CONNECTED TO. This is a physical connectivity. For example, rooms are connected to each other or to hallways.
MAINTAINS. Maintenance of buildings or computing and networking resources. This relationship assumes elevated privilege of one resource that performs maintenance on another resource that is maintained.
USED BY. Similar to maintains relationship but without elevated privileges.

    Next, we have different types of resources:

    1. Material

    2. Non-material

       2a. Information

       2b. Software

       2c. Other

    Resources have the following characteristics:

    1. They are part of some group. Ti is a logical grouping. For example,
       Internet Banking is a group that consists of Web server, application,
       database, servers on which those are running.

    2. Physical location, i.e. where resource is physicaly located. That is
       some other resource, like some server (in case of applications or
       virtual servers) or room in other cases.

    3. Network location, i.e. where resource is located on a network.

    Note that all are resources and their inteconnections, there are no
    some other elements.

    For consistency reasons, the connections are one way and the other way
    is inferred from that one way connection.
